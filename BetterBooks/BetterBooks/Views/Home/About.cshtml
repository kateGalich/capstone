    <h3>About Better Books</h3>

    <p style="color: #0b6e9f;">
        This project helps to organize book sharing in small community. Members can offer or/and request books to read.
        System helps to track who has the book at the moment and manage the queue. We would start small with Kitchener and eventually and
        slowly expand to other town such as Waterloo, and Cambridge and potentially hosting our assignment on amazon web services.
